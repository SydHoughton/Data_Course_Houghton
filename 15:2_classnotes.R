# I mentioned to Dr. Zahn that many of us were feeling frustrated and like lost kittens in the rain
# at the beginning of class we had a discussion on student frustrations and feedback about
# how the class is going. Collectively we decided to devote the first hour of one class a week to 
# open lab where we can work on our code and ask for his help on specific things. 

# This will be helpful, but we all really need to spend 1-2 hours a day working on R to get our skills
# up to where they need to be. 
# look at the course outline on the github page, go through all the assignments again (maybe with a
# different set of data). Understand what the code does and how to work around errors you encounter. 
# We can do this!
